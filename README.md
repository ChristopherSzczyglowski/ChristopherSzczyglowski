### Hi there 👋 
Hi, I'm Chris - a self-taught developer with a passion for programming and product development that borders on the unhealthy...

I began my programming journey during my undergraduate degree at the University of Bristol (UK) and have since spent thousands of hours developing engineering frameworks and libraries for academic and commercial purposes. This culminated in cofounding a startup with two PhD friends which aimed to provide a SaaS product that enabled automated web-based workflows for engineers designing hardware using simulation. 

Unfortunately, I had to leave the startup after 18 months due to a lack of funding as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, I found the entire experience incredibly rewarding and learnt an immense amout about software and product development, including methodologies such as Design Thinking and The Lean Startup's Build-Measure-Learn cycle.

Cofounding a startup exposed me to the complex and exciting world of digital technology and has conviced me that my next job needs to leverage digital tools to have a lasting and positive impact on society. To that end, I am looking for technical product owner roles that allow me to blend my technical and managerial skills to build great products that solve real customer problems.

### My Ethos

* Treat others as you would like to be treated
* Understand your vision, values and purpose and everything else will follow
* A 90% product on time is better than a 100% product late

### Topics I'm interested in

* Minimising the human carbon footprint through data - Seriously, why haven't we gamified this yet??
* Understanding media bias through machine learning - Can we spot 'fake news' and cheap journalism before it has a lasting effect?

### Projects

#### Kaggle Competitions
I am using my downtime between jobs to crunch through a few Kaggle problems. Check out my progress and throw any hot tips my way!

#### [Python Packaging Template](https://github.com/ChristopherSzczyglowski/python_package_template)
My personal knowledge repository on how I like to develop and structure Python packages. 

#### [Natural Environment Research Council Covid-19 Hackathon](https://github.com/BristolFluFighters/BristolFluFighters_NERCHackathonTwo_Recovery)
Awarded second place in a 5 day hackathon investigating the environmental impact of the Covid-19 lockdown in the UK. 

#### Engineering Web Application (Commercial)
Developed an engineering web-application running the MERN stack with scientific Python code running on the server-side. 

Managed the software development lifecycle using tools such as Jira, Confluence and GitHub with CI/CD via CircleCI

#### [Matran](https://github.com/ChristopherSzczyglowski/Matran) 
An attempt to provide an API for the engineering simulation tool Nastran. 

This repo saw heavy use during my PhD but has since been shelved as I transition into a more tech-focussed role.

#### Software Library for post-processing Wind Tunnel Experimental Data (Commercial)
Developed a software suite for post-processing wind tunnel data and comparing experimental observations with numerical simulations as part of the [High Aspect Ratio Tools (HART) project](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=113223).

#### Desktop Application for Novel Aircraft Design (Commercial)
Led the development of a MATLAB-based application for enabling the analysis, design and optimisation of novel aircraft concepts. The application was a joint development between four researchers and an industrial partner as part of the [Agile Wing Integration project](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=113041). 

We utilised the Model-View-Controller architecture to enable an exensible and modular design with front-end widgets provided by the [GUI Layout Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox).
